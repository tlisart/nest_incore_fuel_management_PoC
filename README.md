# Description Project
The NEST software (Non-symbolic empowered swapping tool) is a Proof of Concept
build for Engie-Tractebel in the context of a project-intership in the first
year master degree of physics engineering at ULB.

This program is barely a PoC, the interesting work is exposed in my report to Tractebel, which obviously 
I am not alowed to share. The one-mission job was to find a way to improve in-house workflow in in-core
fuel management for nuclear PWR using modern machine learning approaches. Some interesting solutions were found, however the mission was too short to have hands-on software working as stand alone. 

The grand idea would have been vizualising tools for PWR, as well as human pattern recognition and model-statistics based heuristics for in-core fuel swapping.


# Philosophy 
The IA tools should have been correctly build into bash-scripts for piping data in the compagny's tools ecosystem. Trying to improve the Engineer's workflow. 

# Install
cd into the NEST folder. Then 'make' command. Launching with ./nest.sh
